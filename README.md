💡 This is my final project for the Coderhouse's Web Development course: it's the fifth, and most ambitious, since the course started. It's a redesign of the new version of Blizzard's famous game launcher, Battle.net.

👉 It has the following characteristics:\
1️⃣ 6 sections.\
2️⃣ Layout → Grid.\
3️⃣ Components → Flexbox & Bootstrap.\
4️⃣ Full responsive.
